# Babysit PR

Read [project context](../full-send/references/project-context.md) before
acting. Follow the project's checks, review policy, and communication rules.

Resolve required bots and human approvals from project guidance and live
repository rules. Verify bot findings rather than assuming they are right.

## Waiting

Never write your own watcher, polling loop, or `sleep` loop. Use one watcher
per PR: `watch_pull_request` in T3 Code, `pr-wait` everywhere else. Never run
both on the same PR. Every watcher on a GitHub account shares one rate limit.

### In T3 Code: `watch_pull_request`

Handle the existing checks and comments first. Then call
`watch_pull_request` and end your turn. T3 Code wakes you with a message when
a check fails, the required checks pass, someone comments or reviews, or the
branch conflicts.

- **Only the thread that owns the PR watches it.** If you are a delegated
  child task (a reviewer, a review round, any `delegate_task` child), never call
  `watch_pull_request`. The parent owns the PR. Do not watch PRs you are not
  working on.
- **A wake is news, not a merge decision.** Check the merge gate yourself.
- **Unwatch when you hand off.** A watched thread stays in Working and out of
  the user's inbox. When you stop (ready, blocked, or asking the user a question),
  call `unwatch_pull_request` first. A merge or close ends the watch on its
  own.
- **"Stopped watching, could not read it"** usually means GitHub's rate limit
  is used up. Run `gh api rate_limit --jq .resources.graphql` before you
  watch again. If `remaining` is near 0, wait for `reset` with one background
  command, then watch again. Never watch again in a tight loop.

### Everywhere else: `pr-wait`

Wait with `scripts/pr-wait` from this skill's directory (use its absolute
path).

```bash
pr-wait <pr> [--repo owner/name] [--until ready|green|any-change]
```

It prints one line per real event. It exits 0 when the `--until` condition is
met or the PR merges, 1 when it needs you (a required check failed, conflicts,
unresolved threads, PR closed), and 2 on bad input.

- `ready` (default): required checks green, Greptile or Macroscope reviewed the
  head, and no unresolved threads. Use this only for projects that require
  one of those bots.
- `green`: required checks only. Use it when the repo has no Greptile or
  Macroscope.
- `any-change`: exit on the first event.

In Claude Code, run it with the Monitor tool (`timeout_ms: 3600000`), so each
line wakes you. Without a monitor, run it as one long command. It ends on its
own.

Start it again after you push, after you handle an exit 1, and after a resume.
It remembers what it already reported, so nothing that arrived in between is
lost. If it says another pid already watches the PR, do not start a second one.
Kill the old one only if its events do not reach you.

With either watcher: when an event needs no action, end your turn without a
message. Never post or say "still waiting".

The bundled script recognizes Greptile and Macroscope as ready-gating bots;
it does not evaluate arbitrary project policies. With no such bot requirement,
use `green` for checks and inspect required reviews separately. For another
required bot, use `any-change` notifications and inspect that bot's latest-head
result yourself. A watcher exit is an event, not complete PR readiness.
After laptop sleep or interruption, reread live state and check existing
watcher ownership before restarting. Do not assume an unattended session kept
running. If the host forbids the fallback watcher or cannot keep it alive,
report the wait as blocked instead of inventing a polling loop.

## GitHub rate limits

`gh pr create`, `gh pr view`, and `gh pr checks` use GraphQL. When GraphQL is
used up, the REST limit is separate and usually still has room. Use
`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<n>` to read a PR, and
`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/commits/<sha>/check-runs` for checks.

## Reviews

Evaluate checks on the current head and carry forward unresolved findings
from earlier pushes. A push alone does not resolve a finding. Verify each
finding against the current source before changing code. Fix real findings and CI
failures, distinguish repository failures from infrastructure flakes, and reply
with a written reason when dismissing false positives.

If the repo has `.macroscope/check-run-agents/*.md`, read those rules before you
reply to a Macroscope finding. Its findings cite them.

Treat CodeRabbit or any other bot as advisory unless project policy requires
it. A project's required bot or human reviewer cannot be waived here.

If a review bot leaves feedback you believe is not worth addressing, reply with
a written reason and resolve the comment. Use the `leaving-pr-comments` skill
for every comment posted on the user's behalf.

Screenshots and videos help as well, when you have a way to upload them.

Keep the PR at the size the user's goal needs. Review loops tend to grow a
PR one cheap-looking fix at a time. Fix real bugs in the intended case.
Decline the rest with a written reason, and list them as follow-ups:
unneeded tests, guards for edge cases that do not matter, extra integration
or compatibility, and small performance costs. Prefer the fix that deletes or
narrows code.

## Base branch and merging

Keep an eye on changes to the PR's actual base branch and rebase when needed. `pr-wait` reports when
new base commits touch this PR's files, and when the PR becomes BEHIND or DIRTY.
`watch_pull_request` reports conflicts only, so check for BEHIND yourself
before you call the PR ready.
If an overlapping PR makes this one obsolete, stop monitoring, report it to the
user, and ask before closing the PR unless closure was explicitly authorized.

If nothing has changed, stay quiet rather than posting filler comments. Stop
when the project's readiness gate passes on the latest head; a `pr-wait`
exit 0 alone is insufficient. Merge only when the user explicitly requested it;
otherwise report that the PR is ready. Right before a merge, run `git fetch` and
check the PR again. Never merge when it is BEHIND or DIRTY, or when base commits
that landed after the last green run touch this PR's files. Rebase, push, and
wait for green again.
